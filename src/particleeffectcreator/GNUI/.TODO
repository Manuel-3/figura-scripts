# Clean up
[r] Refactor GNUI's require to be modular
[x] Merge multiple classes as much as possible.
# Rendering
[x] Rewrite text rendering to be more abstract
 - text rendering is awful as of now
[ ] Rewrite Debug mode to be its own library, somehow

# Goal Love2D Compatibility Layer
-- the following todo things are still connected to the base API of Figura. the goal is to add a wrapper in between to allow easy swap of whos using GNUI.
[ ] Input Wrapper
 - Relies on Events Wrapper, complete events wrapper first.
[ ] Create a Renderer Wrapper.
-- a wrapper inbetween the ninepatch library and GNUI is needed to make it swappable.
[ ] Make every events in GNUI rely on the Events Wrapper.
 - Input and Renderer relies on this.
 - Existing Wrapper exists, the goal is apply it to every event in GNUI.
