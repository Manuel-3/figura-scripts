# GNUI
## a simple UI library for Figura.
rewritten atleast 4 times based on people's complaints about the library being too complicated to use. at its current state, expect it to be really easy to use at this point. trust me bro

# How to use
- you can read the wiki for a quick start here
[[Wiki]](https://github.com/lua-gods/GNUI/wiki)

# How to install
## Git Method
- open the terminal and locate your repository, and run the following command
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/lua-gods/GNUI GNUI
```
this will create a folder named GNUI in your repository that is linked to the GNUI repository, so for any updates, you can simply git pull to get the latest changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sumneko lua by default ignores git submodules. Make sure to enable submodules in your repository by setting `"Lua.workspace.ignoreSubmodules":false` your settings.json file  
>  
> and if using [GSRewriteDocs](https://github.com/GrandpaScout/FiguraRewriteVSDocs/) in the `.luarc.json` file, make sure to set `"ignoreSubmodules": false`

## Manual Method
